# CWML-class-Single-cell-RNA-seq-analysis-tutorial-Seurat 

This is a class offered by the Bioinformatics Support Program & Data Services at the Cushing/Whitney Medical Library. It is designed to help beginner level R & RStudio users get used to analyzing their single-cell RNA-seq data using R scripting, via the popular package Seurat, created by the Satija Lab in NYGC (https://satijalab.org/seurat/vignettes.html).  

During the class, participants carry out guided, hands-on scripting to accomplish specific and crucial tasks to analyze a small, publicly avaialble single-cell RNA-seq dataset. The primary goal is to help participants understand the logical flow of the scripts and the task that is being acheived by the function calls. The overarching goal is to empower participants with the knowledge to start using R independently by utilizing resources, such as package documentations and vignettes. 

This session is made up of two parts, Intro to R for Seurat, and Applying the Seurat R Package
